              <p>Learning or working on something complex can be tough and energy-consuming. This app was created to help you concentrate and monitor your progress. People say it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill, and in an era where short-term memory is a grand obstacle, focusing and achieving goals becomes increasingly difficult. However, I believe that even a small start, like dedicating 15 minutes a day to full concentration, is a significant achievement that will work wonders over time. <br></br><br></br>  With this app, you can write down your goals, start a stopwatch, and track your progress on a calendar. I envision this app as a guide or a 'go-to' place for people who share the same values and goals as me. Itâ€™s for those who are eager to learn something new, ready to work every day to better themselves, and are amazed by the endless opportunities of our minds. This app is for people who believe that dedicating time to attain skills can lead to mastery.</p>
